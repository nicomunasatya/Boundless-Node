# Boundless Prover Guide

## Boundless Prover market
First, you need to know how **Boundless Prover market** actually works to realize what you are doing.
* **Requester Submits Ask**: A requester (e.g. developer) creates a task or a computation request as an `order` on Boundless, offering funds in ETH or ERC-20 to incentivize participation.
* **Prover Stakes USDC**: The Boundless market requires funds (USDC) deposited as stake before a prover can `bid` on requests.
* **Prover Places Bid**: A prover detects an `order`, submits a `bid`, stating their offered price or resources, which may be lower than the request’s locked funds or other provers’ `bid`s.
* **Prover Locks Order**: If their `bid` is accepted among other provers (e.g., lower `bid`, sufficient stake, or meeting specific criteria), the prover locks the order committing to prove it within a set deadline (`lock-timeout`) using previously staked `USDC`, so other provers can't touch it until it perform computational power.
* **Prover Generates Proof**: The prover completes the task and submits the `proof` to the network.
* **Slashing**: If the `proof` is invalid, incomplete, or the prover fails to deliver (e.g., due to low computational power, malicious behavior or timeout), the slashing mechanism activates, penalizing the prover by forfeiting a part of their staked `USDC` funds.
* **Order Fulfillment**: If the `proof` is valid, the prover receives the locked funds as a reward, and the requester receives the verified result, completing the process.
* `bid ` are actually `mcycle_price` (the price of each 1 million cycles the prover proves). I'll tell you more about this later in the guide.

## Notes
- The prover is in beta phase, while I admit that my guide is really perfect, you may get some troubles in the process of running it, so you can wait until official incentivized testnet with more stable network and more updates to this guide, or start exprimenting now.
- I advice to start with testnet networks due to loss of stake funds
- I will update this github guide constantly, so you always have to check back here later and follow me on [X](https://x.com/0xMoei) for new updates.

## Requirements
### Hardware
* CPU - 16 threads, reasonable single core boost performance (>3Ghz)
* Memory - 32 GB
* Disk - 100 GB NVME/SSD
* GPU
  * Minimum: one 8GB vRAM GPU
  * Recommended to be competetive: 10x GPU with min 8GB vRAM
  * Recomended GPU models are 4090, 5090 and L4.
> * I've tested the new release with only a 80GB vRAM GPU, I'll update here when I just tested out lower GPUs.
> * You better test it out with single GPUs by lowering your configurations later by reading the further sections.

### Software
* Supported: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04
* No support: Ubuntu 24.04
* If you are running on Windows os locally, install Ubuntu 22 WSL using this [Guide](https://github.com/0xmoei/Install-Linux-on-Windows)

## Rent GPU
* **Beginner Guide**
  * For those new to renting GPUs, refer to [this guide](https://github.com/0xmoei/Rent-and-Config-GPU) for step-by-step instructions.

* **Choosing the Right GPU Template**
  * Rent an `Ubuntu VM` template for your GPU instance.
  * Avoid `CUDA` or `Pytorch` templates, as they are incompatible with the Prover installation.

* **Why Ubuntu VM is Required**
  * Prover installation uses `Docker`. Since `CUDA` or `Pytorch` templates run your GPU instance inside a Docker container, you cannot run the Prover Docker inside another Docker instance.

* **Recommended GPU Providers**
  * **[Vast.ai](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=62897&creator_id=62897&name=Ubuntu%2022.04%20VM)**: Affordable GPU provider supporting `Ubuntu VM` templates with crypto payment options.

# Setup
Here is the step by step guide to Install and run your Prover smoothly, but please pay attention to these notes:
* Read every single word of this guide, if you really want to know what you are doing.
* There is an [Prover+Broker Optimization](https://github.com/0xmoei/boundless/blob/main/README.md#bento-prover--broker-optimizations) section where you need to read after setting up prover.
